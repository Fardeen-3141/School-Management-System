  ## ✨ Key Features

     👨‍💼 Role-Based Access Control: Separate, secure portals for Admins and Students*.
     💳 Advanced Fee Management:*
      *   Define custom fee structures (e.g., Tuition, Admission, Transportation).
         Set up recurring billing cycles: One-Time, Monthly, or Yearly*.
      *   Apply fee structures to all new students by default or assign them individually.
      *   Override standard fee amounts for individual students (for scholarships or concessions).
     🤖 Automated Recurring Billing:* A nightly cron job automatically generates monthly and yearly fee invoices for
  all active students, eliminating manual work and ensuring timely billing.
     💸 Secure Payment & Discount Recording:*
      *   Log payments against specific fees or as a general payment that auto-allocates to the oldest dues.
      *   Record discounts and waivers separately from actual payments.
     ✅ Attendance Tracking:* Mark attendance for individual students or in bulk for an entire class.
     👤 Full Student Lifecycle Management:* Admins can manage all student profile information, view detailed
  financial ledgers, and track academic status.
     📧 Invitation-Only Registration:* Secure onboarding process where admins invite new students and staff via
  email.
     📊 Data-Rich Dashboards:* At-a-glance overview of total collections, outstanding dues, student enrollment
  numbers, and more.

  ## 🛠️ Getting Started: Local Development

  Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

  ### Prerequisites

  *   Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/) (v20.x or later)
  *   pnpm (https://pnpm.io/) (or npm/yarn)
  *   A running PostgreSQL (https://www.postgresql.org/download/) database instance.

  ### 1. Clone the Repository

  `bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
  cd your-repo-name
  `

  ### 2. Install Dependencies

  `bash
  pnpm install

  `

  ### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

  Create a .env.local file in the root of the project by copying the example file:

  `bash
  cp .env.example .env.local
  `

  Now, fill in the required variables in .env.local:

  `env
  # Prisma / PostgreSQL
  DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public"
  DIRECT_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public"


  NextAuth.js
  Vercel Cron Job Security
  `

  This will sync your database with the schema defined in prisma/schema.prisma.

  ### 5. Run the Development Server

  `bash
  pnpm dev
  `

  The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000 (http://localhost:3000).
